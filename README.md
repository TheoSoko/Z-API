#  About The Project

This is a RESTful web API built for interfacing with the Zemus cross-platform mobile application. 

The product has two main aspects: It's a social media platform, and a tool to search for news from the entire world. 


The environment consists of TypeScript, node.js (runtime), Hapi (HTTP library), and Knex (SQL query builder). 

## Tech Stack

**Language:** TypeScript

**Runtime**: Node.js

**Http library:** [Hapi](https://hapi.dev)

**Authentification:** [Hapi/jwt]('https://hapi.dev/module/jwt/)

**SQL query builder:** [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)




### Run Locally



Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server with npm script

```bash
  npm run build
```

The transpilation to JS before the project builds and runs happens "under the hood", thanks to nodemon and ts-node.
